# string-manipulation

> All possible string related manipulation within one package. It returns what you expect as result.

Useful when you don't want to mess up with a bunch of small functions that can help you during the string related manipulation. Easy to use just call the functions with parameters(sometime not needed) from the below and get the desired result.

It is also handy when you have some numbers to be calculated and also will help you to generate [human_readable_random_number].

## Usable Platforms

``` 
It is built for angular 2+ framwork.
```

## Install

``` 
$ npm i string-manipulation
```

## Usage

stringWidth('\u001B[1m古\u001B[22m');

``` -->
